# 🧠 CodeSearchNet Replica Project Roadmap

This guide walks through the major and minor milestones required to build a replica of the CodeSearchNet project, from setup to deployment.

---

## ✅ Project Goal

Build a system that can take a natural language query and return the most relevant code snippet, replicating the functionality of CodeSearchNet.

---

## 🧱 Milestone 1: Project Setup and Dataset Preparation

### Minor Steps:

- [x] **Set up environment**
  - Create a Python virtual environment.
  - Install dependencies: `transformers`, `datasets`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

- [x] **Download and explore the dataset**
  - Use:
    ```python
    from datasets import load_dataset
    ds = load_dataset("code_search_net", "python")
    ```
  - Explore fields like `code`, `docstring`, and `func_name`.

- [x] **Clean and preprocess data**
  - Normalize whitespaces and case.
  - Filter out unusually short or long entries.
  - Tokenize both code and natural language using a transformer tokenizer.

## 📖 Milestone 2: Embedding and Modeling

### Minor Steps:

- [ ] **Build a easy baseline model**
  - Use GRU to build an easy sequence to sequence model.

- [ ] **Implement contrastive/triplet loss**
  - E.g., cosine similarity with margin-based loss or InfoNCE.

- [ ] **Train the model**
  - Train and validate on subsets.
  - Track loss and retrieval performance.
  - Valid function with baseline model

- [ ] **Create attention-based encoder and decoder**
  - Implement attention-based encoder and decoder.
  - Expect to see improvement on prediction accurarcy.

- [ ] **Create query and code encoders**
  - Build dual encoders for natural language and code inputs.

---

## 🔍 Milestone 3: Code Search and Evaluation

### Minor Steps:

- [ ] **Generate code embeddings**
  - Cache embeddings for fast lookup.

- [ ] **Embed the query and compute similarity**
  - Use cosine or dot-product similarity.

- [ ] **Rank code snippets**
  - Sort based on similarity scores and return top-K results.

- [ ] **Evaluate**
  - Use metrics: MRR, Recall@1/5/10.

---

## 🧪 Milestone 4: Optimization and Scaling

### Minor Steps:

- [ ] **Use FAISS for fast search**
  - Index code embeddings with FAISS.
  - Perform ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) search.

- [ ] **Improve model**
  - Use more advanced models like GraphCodeBERT or CodeT5.
  - Apply hard negative mining.

- [ ] **Experiment tracking**
  - Use `wandb`, `mlflow`, or `tensorboard`.

---

## 🌐 Milestone 5: Web Interface (Optional)

### Minor Steps:

- [ ] **Create frontend UI**
  - Use `Streamlit`, `Flask`, or a basic HTML/JS app.

- [ ] **Backend model integration**
  - Accept user queries → embed → search → return ranked code results.
